# SCSS Example Project

This is a simple example project to demonstrate how to use the SCSS in a project. We are using a VS Code extension called [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) to compile the SCSS into CSS.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
4. Open the `style.scss` file and click on Watch Sass and start editing
5. The `style.css` file will be updated automatically
